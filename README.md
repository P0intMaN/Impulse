# INTRODUCTION

**_Impulse_** is a clever and easy to use **DOS ( Denial Of Service )** Tool meant to disrupt the service or bring down an online site. Hackers use this technique of **DOSing** and perform it in a huge phenomenal scale with the help of serveral computers (or local programs) also called **BOTNETS**,   that keep on DOSing a particular service (more commonly a site) until that service is down, in a process called **DDOS ( Distributed Denial Of Service ) attack**
