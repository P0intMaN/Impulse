# IMPULSE
###### Developed by Pratheek 'The P0intMaN'


## INTRODUCTION

**_Impulse_** is a clever and easy to use **DOS ( Denial Of Service )** Tool meant to disrupt the service or bring down an online site. Hackers use this technique of **DOSing** and perform it in a huge phenomenal scale with the help of serveral computers (or local programs) also called **BOTNETS**,   that keep on DOSing a particular service (more commonly a site) until that service is down, in a process called **DDOS ( Distributed Denial Of Service ) attack**

## DETAILS

- Just like my [**previous programs**](https://github.com/P0intMaN?tab=repositories), **_Impulse_** also has a similar interface and is relatively very easy to use as compared to other **DOS tools**.

- **Very Fast DOSing at a lower bandwidth**

- Available for both **Windows** and **Linux**

- **_PRO TIP : When IMPULSE is paired with [PELICAN PORT SCANNER](https://github.com/P0intMaN/Pelican), it becomes the deadliest combo ever.. You are welcome!_**


## THE INTERFACE WALKTHROUGH

- **_Impulse_** interface is divided into two parts --> **Beginning Interface** and **DOS Interface**

- **Beginning Interface** prompts you to input either *the website url* or the *IP address* on which you have to perform DOS 

- **DOS Interface** executes the **DOS attack**.

- Once you have started **DOSing**, you can *terminate* it by simply closing the **_Impule_** Program
